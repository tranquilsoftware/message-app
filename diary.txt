09/08 – Started foundation of some components and socket authetncation stuff. Need to start setting up Express with Mongo.db

11/08

realised db not working cause im not typing in TERMINAL

  node server.js

MANUALLY RUN FIRST THEN IT CAN SUCCESSFULLY RUN CORS REQUESTS.

12/08 Dashboard now opening correctly! Time to start developing dashboard..

if logged in, and go to /login. it routes to /... NOTHING , review routing...


23/08/2024
I have been developing the project a little every day or two;
1.	implementing MongoDB,
2.	implementing the routing that is dependant on the local storage (login tokens)
3.	developing the authentication services and fixing styling issues

I am working on the styling as well today! My goal is to design a message app that looks aesthetic on mobile devices and personal computers. (with very little overhead).



24/08

registering logs in correctly with token

but logging in does not log in , and go to dashboard..

  - suspected issues with bcrypt comparing passwords i am assuming

  - also noticed when we register a usr, we should automatically assume they are user by default, (we are not setting anything rn)

.. fixed bcrypt ! had old code trying to request the password from the db (thinking its stored in raw data format)..

working great, registration works flawlessly, login works flawlessly.

After a long night of debugging. It was found that the culprit of the BUG that didnt update the MongoDB User's settings

WAS BECAUSE THERE WAS A EXTRA / FRONT SLASH BEHIND THE API URL!!!!

I caught the bug when i implemented the following function into Server.js to handle unhandled requests (print them)

    app.use((req, res, next) => {
      console.log(`Unhandled request: ${req.method} ${req.url}`);
      next();
    });

    todo: fix uploading pp
          implement sockets to chat... upload message to Messages, with group room id etc



Error getting: Header Request GET ws://localhost:5000/socket.io/?EIO=4&transport=websocket

Navigated to chat room. navigation.service.ts:26:12
Waterfox can’t establish a connection to the server at ws://localhost:5000/socket.io/?EIO=4&transport=websocket. websocket.js:35:102
Socket connection error: Error: websocket error

FIXED.

i declare io like:

    const io = require('socket.io')(server, {
      pingTimeout: 5000, // 5 secs
      cors: {
        origin: "http://localhost:5000",
        methods: ["GET", "POST"],
        allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type", "Authorization"],
        credentials: true
      }
    });

 which solved the fucking socket bug! lol

(socket) Message received: {
  _id: '',
  chatRoomId: '1',
  senderId: { _id: '', username: '', profile_pic: './img/default_user.png' },
  userId: '66c9a69c1e190c5e1af17d5d',
  msgContent: '////////////',
  timestamp: '2024-08-29T13:16:15.660Z',
  read: false
}


sockets receiving messages, Now....
 todo:
    save a message model every new message,
    On chatboard initiailization, load previous existing messages, etc.
    on new-message it should populate to all other clients on the server/chat room
whats working:
  socket recognises when: a user joins a server, recognises message received.

- I will not use raw passwords throughout the further development of the project as I want to gain experience with real time databases whilst incorporating sing bcrypt

Authorisation Token was not supplied in the request header.

BUG FOUND in auth.interceptor. I had not typed "Authorisation"

bug code:
        request = request.clone({
          setHeaders: {
            Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`
          }
        });

beautiful working code:

        intercept(request: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler) {
          const token = this.authenticationService.getToken();
          console.log('(Authentication Interceptor) - Token:', token);

          const authRequest = request.clone({
            headers: request.headers.set("Authorization", "Bearer " + token)
          });

          return next.handle(authRequest);
        }
